# Cybersecurity RCA Report

## 1) Suspected Root Cause
- **Confidence Level**: Unable to quantify confidence due to lack of data (no top-k root candidates or scores available).
- **Current Findings**: No predictions or ground truth provided, indicating potential issues with data collection or model performance.

## 2) Chain Comparison
- **Exact Matches**: None identified due to absence of predicted and true chains.
- **Mismatches**: No mismatches can be reported as there are no available predictions or ground truth.

## 3) Evidence Bullets
- **Modal Contributions**:
  - **Logs**: 0.090 (p25=0.063, p50=0.090, p75=0.108) - Indicates low contribution from logs.
  - **Metrics**: 0.616 (p25=0.295, p50=0.690, p75=0.795) - Suggests metrics are a significant contributor.
  - **Traces**: 0.294 (p25=0.121, p50=0.201, p75=0.611) - Moderate contribution from traces.
- **Temporal/Structural Cues**: No temporal or structural cues available for analysis.

## 4) Remediation Steps & Monitoring Items
1. **Data Collection Review**: Investigate the data pipeline to ensure that predictions and ground truth are being captured correctly.
2. **Model Performance Evaluation**: Assess the model's ability to generate predictions and validate its training process.
3. **Increase Logging**: Enhance logging mechanisms to capture more detailed information for future analysis.

## 5) Limitations & Next Checks
- **Limitations**: Lack of data prevents a thorough analysis of the root cause and chain comparison.
- **Next Checks**:
  - Verify the integrity of the data collection process.
  - Check for any anomalies in the model's training and prediction phases.
  - Ensure that the model is receiving the correct input parameters (num_nodes, time_dim, heads/hidden).

# Cybersecurity RCA Report

## 1) Suspected Root Cause
The predicted root cause is **Node 44**, which matches the ground truth root cause. The model achieved a **test accuracy of 96.25%** and a **root hit@1 score of 1.0**, indicating high confidence in the prediction. The **confidence margin** between the top candidate (Node 44) and the second candidate (Node 204) is **0.4839**, suggesting a strong preference for Node 44 as the root cause.

## 2) Chain Comparison
The predicted chain matches the ground truth chain exactly:
- **Predicted Chain**: [44, 20, 204, 370, 283, 207, 279, 293, 25, 153]
- **True Chain**: [44, 20, 204, 370, 283, 207, 279, 293, 25, 153]

### Matches:
- All elements in the predicted chain are present in the true chain.

### Mismatches:
- None. The chains are identical.

## 3) Evidence Bullets
- **Modal Contributions**:
  - **Logs**: 0.090 (p50=0.090) indicates moderate relevance.
  - **Metrics**: 0.616 (p50=0.690) shows strong contribution to the prediction.
  - **Traces**: 0.294 (p50=0.201) suggests some relevance but less than logs and metrics.
- **Temporal Cues**: The model's performance over time dimensions (8) indicates stability in predictions.
- **Structural Cues**: The high **chain Jaccard score of 0.999999999** confirms the robustness of the chain prediction.

## 4) Remediation Steps & Monitoring Items
1. **Immediate Review**: Validate the integrity of Node 44 and its connections.
2. **Log Analysis**: Deep dive into logs to identify any anomalies or patterns leading to the incident.
3. **Metrics Evaluation**: Continuously monitor metrics contributions to ensure they remain within expected ranges.
4. **Chain Validation**: Regularly verify the accuracy of predicted chains against ground truth to maintain model reliability.

## 5) Limitations & Next Checks
- **Limitations**: The model's reliance on historical data may not account for novel attack vectors or changes in network behavior.
- **Next Checks**:
  - Assess the impact of external factors on Node 44 and its related nodes.
  - Conduct a follow-up analysis after implementing remediation steps to ensure effectiveness.
  - Explore additional data sources to enhance model robustness and adaptability.
